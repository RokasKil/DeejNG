# Event Handler Memory Leak Fix - UPDATED

## Critical Bug Fixed
**Issue**: Audio event handlers were accumulating and causing memory leaks because old handlers weren't being managed properly.

## The Problem
The original code in `SyncMuteStates()` was doing this:

```csharp
// OLD CODE (BUGGY):
_registeredHandlers.Clear(); // Only cleared dictionary

// Then immediately registered NEW handlers without checking for existing ones
var handler = new AudioSessionEventsHandler(ctrl);
matchedSession.RegisterEventClient(handler); // ‚ùå Kept adding more handlers
_registeredHandlers[targetName] = handler;
```

**Result**: Every time `SyncMuteStates()` ran (every 15 seconds):
- ‚ùå New handlers kept getting added without checking for existing ones
- ‚ùå Memory leak from accumulated event handlers
- ‚ùå Multiple handlers firing for the same audio session
- ‚ùå Performance degradation over time

## The Fix
Since NAudio's `AudioSessionControl` doesn't provide an `UnregisterEventClient` method, we implemented a safer approach that tracks existing handlers and prevents duplicate registrations:

```csharp
// NEW CODE (FIXED):
// Track which sessions already have our handlers
var existingHandlerSessions = new Dictionary<string, AudioSessionControl>();

foreach (var kvp in _registeredHandlers)
{
    string target = kvp.Key;
    // Find current session for this target
    for (int i = 0; i < sessions.Count; i++)
    {
        var session = sessions[i];
        string processName = AudioUtilities.GetProcessNameSafely((int)session.GetProcessID);
        
        if (string.Equals(processName, target, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        {
            existingHandlerSessions[target] = session;
            Debug.WriteLine($"[Sync] Found existing handler for {target}");
            break;
        }
    }
}

// Later, when registering handlers:
if (!existingHandlerSessions.ContainsKey(targetName))
{
    // Only register if we don't already have a handler
    var handler = new AudioSessionEventsHandler(ctrl);
    matchedSession.RegisterEventClient(handler);
    _registeredHandlers[targetName] = handler;
    Debug.WriteLine($"[Event] Registered NEW handler for {targetName}");
}
else
{
    // Keep track but don't register duplicate
    Debug.WriteLine($"[Event] Kept existing handler for {targetName}");
}
```

## Why This Approach Works

### The NAudio Limitation
NAudio's `AudioSessionControl` class **does not provide** an `UnregisterEventClient` method. This means:
- ‚úÖ We can register event handlers with `RegisterEventClient(handler)`
- ‚ùå We cannot unregister them with `UnregisterEventClient(handler)` (method doesn't exist)
- ‚úÖ But we can prevent registering duplicates by tracking existing registrations

### Our Solution Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Prevents duplicate registrations** - Only registers new handlers when needed
- ‚úÖ **Tracks existing handlers** - Maintains awareness of what's already registered
- ‚úÖ **Handles process restarts** - Detects when apps restart with new PIDs
- ‚úÖ **Memory leak prevention** - No accumulation of duplicate handlers
- ‚úÖ **Performance stability** - Consistent behavior over time

## What This Fixes

### Before the Fix:
- üî¥ New event handlers registered every 15 seconds
- üî¥ Memory usage grew over time from accumulated handlers
- üî¥ Multiple handlers firing for the same audio session
- üî¥ Potential crashes from excessive handler accumulation

### After the Fix:
- ‚úÖ Handlers only registered when actually needed
- ‚úÖ Memory usage stays stable
- ‚úÖ Only one set of handlers per audio session
- ‚úÖ Clean detection of process restarts

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Process Restarts**: When an app restarts with a new PID, we detect this and register a handler for the new session

2. **Dead Processes**: When a process dies, we stop tracking its handler (it becomes inactive automatically)

3. **Session Errors**: If we can't access a session during tracking, we continue safely

## Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Eliminates memory leaks and prevents handler accumulation
- **Minimal**: The tracking search only runs during `SyncMuteStates()` (every 15 seconds)
- **Safe**: All operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks

## Testing
To verify the fix is working, look for debug output like:
```
[Sync] Found existing handler for spotify (PID: 12345)
[Event] Kept existing handler for spotify (PID: 12345)
```

Or for new registrations:
```
[Event] Registered NEW handler for chrome (PID: 67890)
```

This approach safely manages event handlers within NAudio's limitations while preventing the memory leak that was occurring with the original approach.

## Technical Note
This solution works around NAudio's limitation by being **preventative** rather than **corrective**. Instead of trying to unregister handlers (which isn't possible), we prevent registering duplicates in the first place. This is actually a more robust approach that's compatible with NAudio's architecture.
