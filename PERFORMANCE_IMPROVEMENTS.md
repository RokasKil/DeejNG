# DeejNG Performance and Stability Improvements

## Overview
I've implemented comprehensive fixes to address the performance degradation and serial port handling issues in your DeejNG application. These improvements focus on reducing memory leaks, optimizing resource usage, and improving serial communication reliability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Memory Leak Fixes
- **COM Object Management**: Improved cleanup of AudioSessionControl COM objects with proper reference counting
- **Session Cache Limits**: Reduced max session cache from 100 to 25 entries, with more aggressive cleanup
- **Process Cache Optimization**: Limited process name cache to 50 entries with periodic cleanup
- **Forced Cleanup Timer**: Reduced interval from 10 to 5 minutes for more frequent resource cleanup

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Unmapped Application Throttling**: Increased throttling from 100ms to 250ms to reduce CPU usage
- **Cached Mapped Applications**: Added 1-second cache for mapped application lists
- **Peak Level Caching**: Cache unmapped peak levels for 500ms to reduce meter update overhead
- **System Process Filtering**: Skip system processes (PID < 100) to avoid Win32Exceptions

### 3. Serial Port Improvements
- **Buffer Management**: Reduced buffer limit from 8KB to 2KB with intelligent partial data recovery
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper cleanup on disconnect with buffer flushing
- **Connection Parameters**: Added DTR/RTS enable for better hardware compatibility
- **Line Ending Handling**: Support for both \n and \r\n line endings
- **Data Validation**: Added format validation before processing serial data

### 4. Resource Management
- **Aggressive Cleanup**: Force garbage collection with large object heap compaction
- **Event Handler Management**: Proper unregistration of audio event handlers
- **Input Device Cache**: Regular cleanup of input device cache
- **Timer Management**: Stop all timers properly on application close

## Technical Details

### Memory Usage Reduction
- Session cache reduced from unlimited to max 10-25 entries
- Process cache limited to 50 entries
- More frequent COM object release cycles
- Proper disposal of Process objects after use

### CPU Usage Reduction
- Unmapped applications updated only every 250ms (was 100ms)
- Volume change threshold set to 2% (was 5%)
- Peak meter updates cached for 500ms
- Mapped applications list cached for 1 second

### Serial Communication Robustness
- Buffer overflow protection with partial data recovery
- Proper port cleanup on disconnect
- Enhanced reconnection logic
- Support for variable line endings

## Expected Results
- Significantly reduced memory usage over time
- Lower CPU utilization, especially with many audio sessions
- More stable serial communication
- Faster recovery from device disconnections
- No more sluggish UI after extended runtime

## Monitoring
You can monitor the improvements by:
1. Checking Task Manager for memory usage over time
2. Observing CPU usage patterns
3. Watching Debug output for cleanup messages
4. Testing serial disconnect/reconnect scenarios

The application should now maintain consistent performance even after running for extended periods.
